Go and find yourself a toy
Baby, my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy
If you are serious
Don't play with my heart, it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then, baby, I will, girl, you know I will
Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside of me
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride
Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby, go on and live
Tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with, go and find yourself a toy
But I
Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive
And I'm not your little boy
Mmm, tell it like it is", genre: "Soul" )

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people (ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?", original_artist: "The Beatles")

Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you, baby
I wanna stop and thank you baby, yes I do
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Feels so fine
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I wanna stop and thank you, baby
I just wanna stop and thank you baby, oh yes
How sweet it is to be loved by you
It's like sugar sometimes
How sweet it is to be loved by you
You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else

I just wanna stop and thank you baby, oh now

To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
